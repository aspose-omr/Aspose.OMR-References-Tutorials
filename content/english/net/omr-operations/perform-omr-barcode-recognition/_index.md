In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of performing Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) with Barcode Recognition in .NET using the Aspose.OMR for .NET library. This powerful tool allows you to extract data from scanned images containing marked areas and barcodes, making it an essential component for various applications such as surveys, assessments, and data collection.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
1. Visual Studio: Ensure you have Visual Studio installed on your system.
2. Aspose.OMR for .NET Library: Download and install the Aspose.OMR for .NET library from the [official website](https://releases.aspose.com/omr/net/).
3. Basic Knowledge of .NET: Familiarity with .NET framework and C# programming language.
## Import Namespaces
Before diving into the code, import the necessary namespaces:
```csharp
using Aspose.OMR.Api;
using System;
using System.IO;
```
Let's break down the example code into multiple steps:
## Step 1: Define Template and User Image Paths
First, specify the paths for the template file and the user's scanned image:
```csharp
string TemplateName = @"AsposeTestWithBarcode.omr";
string UserImage = "AsposeTestWithBarcode.jpg";
```
## Step 2: Prepare Input and Output
Prepare the input and output directories for the OMR processing:
```csharp
string testFolderPath = "Your Document Directory";
string templatePath = Path.Combine(testFolderPath, TemplateName);
string outputPath = "Your Output Directory";
```
## Step 3: Initialize OMR Engine
Initialize the Aspose.OMR engine to begin processing:
```csharp
OmrEngine engine = new OmrEngine();
```
## Step 4: Load Template
Load the OMR template into the template processor:
```csharp
TemplateProcessor templateProcessor = engine.GetTemplateProcessor(templatePath);
Console.WriteLine("Template loaded.");
```
## Step 5: Recognize Image
Perform OMR and barcode recognition on the user's scanned image:
```csharp
string imagePath = Path.Combine(testFolderPath, UserImage);
string csvResult = templateProcessor.RecognizeImage(imagePath).GetCsv();
```
## Step 6: Export Result
Export the OMR result to a CSV file:
```csharp
File.WriteAllText(Path.Combine(outputPath, Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension(UserImage) + ".csv"), csvResult);
Console.WriteLine("Result exported. Path: " + Path.Combine(outputPath, Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension(UserImage) + ".csv"));
```
## Step 7: Conclusion
You have successfully performed Optical Mark Recognition with Barcode Recognition in .NET using Aspose.OMR for .NET. This powerful library simplifies the extraction of data from scanned images, making it ideal for various applications requiring data collection and analysis.
## Conclusion
In conclusion, leveraging the Aspose.OMR for .NET library enables seamless integration of Optical Mark Recognition and Barcode Recognition capabilities into your .NET applications. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can efficiently extract data from scanned images, opening up numerous possibilities for surveying, assessment, and data processing tasks.
