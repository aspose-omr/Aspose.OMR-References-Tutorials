In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of performing Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) on images in .NET using the Aspose.OMR for .NET library. OMR is a technique used to recognize and extract data from marked areas on images, making it invaluable for tasks such as surveys, assessments, and data collection.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
1. Visual Studio: Make sure you have Visual Studio installed on your system.
2. Aspose.OMR for .NET Library: Download and install the Aspose.OMR for .NET library from the [releases](https://releases.aspose.com/omr/net/).
3. Basic Knowledge of .NET: Familiarize yourself with the .NET framework and C# programming language.
## Import Namespaces
Start by importing the necessary namespaces:
```csharp
using Aspose.OMR.Api;
using System;
using System.IO;
```
Let's break down the example code into multiple steps for clarity:
## Step 1: Define Template and User Image Paths
First, specify the paths for the OMR template and user images:
```csharp
string TemplateName = @"Sheet.omr";
string[] UserImages = new string[] { "Sheet1.jpg", "Sheet2.jpg" };
```
## Step 2: Prepare Input and Output
Prepare the input and output directories for OMR processing:
```csharp
string testFolderPath = "Your Document Directory";
string templatePath = Path.Combine(testFolderPath, TemplateName);
string outputPath = "Your Output Directory";
```
## Step 3: Initialize OMR Engine
Initialize the Aspose.OMR engine to begin processing:
```csharp
OmrEngine engine = new OmrEngine();
```
## Step 4: Load Template
Load the OMR template into the template processor:
```csharp
TemplateProcessor templateProcessor = engine.GetTemplateProcessor(templatePath);
Console.WriteLine("Template loaded.");
```
## Step 5: Iterate Through User Images
Iterate through each user image to perform OMR:
```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < UserImages.Length; i++)
{
    string imagePath = Path.Combine(testFolderPath, UserImages[i]);
    string csvResult = templateProcessor.RecognizeImage(imagePath).GetCsv();
    File.WriteAllText(Path.Combine(outputPath, Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension(UserImages[i]) + ".csv"), csvResult);
    Console.WriteLine("Result exported. Path: " + Path.Combine(outputPath, Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension(UserImages[i]) + ".csv"));
}
```
## Step 6: Conclusion
You've successfully performed Optical Mark Recognition on images in .NET using Aspose.OMR for .NET. This capability streamlines the extraction of data from images, facilitating various applications such as surveys and assessments.
## Conclusion
In conclusion, the Aspose.OMR for .NET library provides a powerful solution for Optical Mark Recognition tasks in .NET applications. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can seamlessly integrate OMR functionality into your projects, enabling efficient data extraction from images.
